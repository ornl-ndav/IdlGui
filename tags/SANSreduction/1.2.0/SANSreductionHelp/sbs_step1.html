This is the part of the GUI you use to load a NeXus file. If <i>findnexus</i> 
is in your path (check first line of log book for that), you can enter a run 
number next to the <b>Run Number</b> label and hit <font color=blue>ENTER
</font>. If the NeXus file is found, its file name is displayed next to the 
label<font color=red>Nexus File Name</font>. If you know your proposal 
number, you can select this one in the proposal droplist. This will speed up 
the search of the NeXus via <i>findnexus</i>.You can also used the 
<font color=red>BROWSE</font> button to look for your NeXus file.<br><br>
Once the NeXus file has been located, the data are plotted. Don't forget to 
check the LogBook to get a more precise description of the process.<br><br>

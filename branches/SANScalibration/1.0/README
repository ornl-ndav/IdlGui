SANScalibration is a Graphical User Interface on top of the LENS Data Reduction 
program.

Requirements:
	install the IDL Virtual Machine for your system
	(http://www.ittvis.com/download/download.asp?urlProductCode=13)

To install this application, just run install_SANScalibration. 
This program will create a idl/SANScalibration/ folder in /usr/local/ and 
copy the necessary folders and the .sav (IDL Virtual Machine executable 
file) in this folder. 
In the same time, the execuable file (SANScalibration) will be created in
/usr/local/bin/. 

> sudo ./install_SANScalibration

You will need administrator privileges to install the software at the default
location (/usr/local/). You won't need those priveleges if you want to install 
it in your home directory (ex: ~/usr/local)

It is possible to overwrite the folder where to install the package and the
location of the executable, using the -d and -n flags

> ./install_SANScalibration -d <where to intall the package> 
                            -e <where to put the executable>

ex: 
> ./install_SANScalibration -d /usr/local/bin/ -e ~/bin/

To run the application, launch the executable file you defined
> /usr/local/SANScalibration

or, if /usr/local is in your path

> SANScalibration

You can get help about how to install this software doing
> ./install_SANScalibration -h
or send an email to

<ul>
  <li><a name="Q1"><u>My run number can not be found</u></a>: several reasons for
that. The main one is that the run number does not exist anymore on the DAS.
Another solution can be that you are looking for a run that analysis computer
you are currently running can not see. For example any of the Liquids runs can not
be seen from <i>mrac</i>. To help us figure out why you can not see the file press 
the <font color=red>SEND TO GEEK</font> button.<br><br></li>
  <li><a name="Q2"><u>What is exactly the SEND TO GEEK button?</u></a>: When using 
this button, a copy of the log book plus a few information about the current session 
is sent to bilheuxjm@ornl.gov. This allows us to get a copy of your session and see 
what went wrong and help us in solving the issue you had. Do not hesitate to add a 
message to help us solving the problem. Of course, you can also used this button to 
tell us how much you love the application ;-).<br><br></li>
   <li><a name="Q3"><u>The run I'm looking for was found but the CREATE NEXUS button is still disabled, what do I have to do to be able to run the translation?</u></a>: This
is probably due to the fact that the parsing of the runinfo files failed. The parsing
of this file is used to automatically populate the histogram parameters (time offset,
 max time, bin width and binning type) using the information defined in the DAS. If the
parsing failed, that means you have to provide those informations manually to be able to
activate the <font color="red">CREATE NEXUS</font>.<br><br>
</li>
   <li><a name="Q4"><u>My proposal does not show up in the list of proposal</u></a>:
this is due to the fact that the proposal was created after you start the
application. So just restart the application the the list of proposal will be refreshed
 and your proposal will show up.<br><br></li>
   <li><a name="Q5"><u>What the <i>Copy -> Instrument Shared Folder</i> and <i>Copy -> Proposal Shared Folder</i> switches mean?</u></a>: If you want to share the NeXus file(s) you are going to create with your proposal teamate, then click the <font color="red">Copy -> Proposal Shared Folder</font> and if you want to share it/them with all the instrument users, then click <font color="red">Copy -> Instrument Shared Folder</font>.<br><br></li>
   <li><a name="Q6"><u>Who should I thank for this wonderful application?</u></a>: For the 'ugly face' (the command line side of the application) that will be Peter Peterson (petersonpf@ornl.gov) and for the 'pretty face' (the GUI) that will be Jean Bilheux (bilheuxjm@ornl.gov).<br><br></li>

  <li><a name="load1"><u>The run number I'm looking for can not be found:</u></a> that problem can be caused by various factor. #1, make sure the program <i>findnexus</i> is in your path. For that, check the top of the LogBook and see if the program found it. If it says FAILED next to <i>findnexus</i>, then you know what to do, install findnexus (contact <font color=blue>pf9@ornl.gov</font> if you want more information about findnexus). #2, your file is not where is should be. <i>findenxus</i> looks for the NeXus files only in a few specic places. If you want <i>findnexus</i> to systematically look your NeXus files in a specific folder, just let me know and I will add this option (<font color=blue>j35@ornl.gov</font>).</li>

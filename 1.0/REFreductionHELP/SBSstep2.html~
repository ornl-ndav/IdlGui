<p>There are 4 ways to select the Backgound Region and 3 ways to select the Peak Exclusion Region:
<ul>
<li><u>Using the mouse (background and peak)</u> Left click and without releasing the button move to the right location on the plot to set the first border of the background region. Release the left button to save the location. If you want to change this border, repeat the procedure. To switch to the other border, right click. The working border status switch from Ymin to Ymax. You can come back to the selection of Ymin by another right click. The current selection is defined by the status of the top option boxes. If <b>Select Background</b> is selected, you are working with the Background selection region. If the <b>Select Peak</b> is selected, you are working on the Peak Region. And at last, if the <b>ZOOM mode</b> is selected, you are working in just a preview mode that gives you a zoom of the plot (top right part of the GUI) of the position of the mouse over the ploting region.
</li>
<li><u>Using the keys <b>u</b> and <b>d</b> (background and peak)</u> If you want to move one of the border of the selection, you can use the <font color=red size=4>u</font> key to move the selection up by 1 pixel, or the <font color=red size=4>d</font> key to move the selection down by 1 pixel.  
</li>
<li><u>Using the text boxes (background and peak)</u> Just enter a value in the text box of the selection you want to plot and press <font color=red size=4>ENTER</font>.</li>
<li><u>Using the <font color=blue size=4>LOAD</font> button (background)</u> If a selection has been previously saved, just click the <font color=blue size=4>LOAD</font> button, select the file you want to use and press <font color=blue size=4>OK</font>. A preview of the file loaded is displayed in the right part of the GUI and the background selection is displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to get an accurate selection by selecting the <font color=blue size=4>ZOOM</font> tab in the top right corner of the GUI. This way, you will be able to select a region and see in the same time a zoom of the region surrounding the mouse cursor.
<p>Using the <font color=blue size=4>SAVE</font> button you can save the selection of the background region you just made. You can modify the name and path of the file in the text box placed just below this button. A preview of the file you then just created is displayed in the right part of the GUI with the full name of the file.

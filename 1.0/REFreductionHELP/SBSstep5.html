<h2>Using the Batch Mode</h2>
Using this GUI, it is possible to run live or in the background a set of Data 
Reduction.<br><br>
<center><img src='SbSstep5.png'></center>
<p>The table is populated each time a data reduction has been run with success. 
It is then possible to modify the DATA and/or NORMALIZATION runs from the current 
selected row and re-run all the ACTIVE row or save it for later use.</p>
<p>The following picture shows the various states of a row:
<ul><li>1<sup>st</sup> row is the freshly added data reduction process</li>
    <li>2<sup>nd</sup> row is an activated command line with no normalization 
run</li>
    <li>3<sup>rd</sup> row is an inactivated command line. This means that this 
command line won't be run</li>
    <li>4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> row are activated run with both Data 
and Normalization runs</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a row has been selected, each column of information is displayed in 
the <font color=blue size=4>Selected Run Number Information Box</font>. The user 
can then change the <b>active status</b> of the row, the <b>Data runs</b> and if 
any, the <b>Normalization runs</b>. You can either click <font color=red>
ENTER</font> to validate the changes or wait for the application to pop up
a window that confirm the changes when you select another row or click the
<font color=blue>REPOPULATE GUI</font> button. <br>

<p>It is possible to move any selection up using the <font color=blue size=4>
MOVE UP SELECTION</font> and down using the <font color=blue size=4>MOVE DOWN 
SELECTION</font> buttons. The it is also possible to delete the current selected 
row using <font color=blue size=4>DELETE SELECTION</font> or all the active rows 
using <font color=blue size=4>DELETE ACTIVE</font>.<br>
Then to run all the active rows live, just click <font color=blue size=4>RUN 
ACTIVE LIVE</font>, or to run them in the background, use <font color=blue 
size=4>RUN ACTIVE IN BACKGROUND</font>. Running the jobs in background give you 
the control of the application back right away and you don't have to wait for 
the jobs to end.<br>

<p>If you are running <u>the jobs live</u>, a progress bar will keep you inform 
of the status of the jobs.<br>
If you are running <u>the jobs in background</u>, the following web page 
(https://portal.sns.gov/snsapps/tabs/squeue.php?view=all) will give you the 
status of each jobs (row) you launched.<br>
